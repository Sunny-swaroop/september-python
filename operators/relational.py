#relational  operators
#<,>,<=,>=,==,!=.
#example
num1=int(input("enter the first number:"))
num2=int(input("enter the second number:"))
num3=int(input("enter the third number:"))
if num1>num2 and num1>num3:
    print(f"the {num1} is greater  number")
elif num2>num3:
    print(f"the {num2} is greater number")
else:
    print(f"the {num3} is greater number")
#similarly we can write a program for "<","<=",">="
#and also for "==","!="
