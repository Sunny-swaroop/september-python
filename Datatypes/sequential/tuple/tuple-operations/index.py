#index operation
#this operation is used to call one element from the tuple using index values
#example
t=10,20,30 #by default it will store in tuple
print(t)
print(type(t))
t1=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)#for best practising use "()"
print(t1[0])#to call tuple we have to use "[]"
print(t1[-1])#we can also call tuple in -ve index values and it comes from backwards
            #it will dispaly "9"
